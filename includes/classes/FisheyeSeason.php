 * TV season — extends FisheyeImage with content_type_guid='fisheyeseason'.
 *
 * The real, folder-leaf content_id in the show->season->episode tree (a "show" itself has no
 * content_id at all - it's a computed, FoodDay-pattern browsing level over its seasons, not yet
 * built - see fisheye.md's 2026-09-02 entry). Ring-fences season-level metadata (genre/director/
 * writer/star/content_rating/duration, IMDB+TheTVDB links) plus the EPISODE xref item away from
 * plain fisheyeimage photo rows and from FisheyeFilm/FisheyeAlbum's own item sets - no other
 * behavioural difference from FisheyeImage, same pattern as Contact/ContactPerson/ContactBusiness.
